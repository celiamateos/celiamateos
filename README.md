### 🌱 I am a student at the 42 madrid school, where I am learning C, C++ and a lot more. ###

### 👀 I’m interested in improving people's quality of life through the development of technological strategies. ###
💞️ I am looking to collaborate in education-related projects to develop my hard and soft skills.
### 🕰️ Past, present and future ###
 Since my childhood, I have always been very interested in technology and everything related to artificial intelligence.
 
I worked for 3 years as a social integrator and decided to turn my life around by immersing myself in the world of programming in a semi-autodidactic way, since the methodology of my school is peer-to-peer, project-based learning, without teachers or classes.
